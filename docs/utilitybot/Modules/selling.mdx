# Selling

## Information

The selling module offers a way for players to sell their items and dinos trough your discord server. The true power of this module is that it allows you to create a marketplace for your players to trade their items and dinos with each other.

When a player uses the `/sell` command it creates a sale embed in the sales channel where other players can react to by clicking on the button below. When someone clicks on the button the module will create a private negotiation channel where the 2 players can negotiate the sale.

Once both players have completed the trade the seller can click on the `Complete Sale` button in the private channel to complete the sale. The module will then remove the sale embed from the sales channel and the private negotiation channel. This way you can keep your sales channel clean and only show active sales.

If the buyer or seller does not complete the sale or cancel the sale the negotiation channel will be deleted and the sale will stay available in the sales channel.

## Command(s)

**`/sell <item> <amount> <price> <map> (info) (image)`** - Creates a sale message in the sales channel.
