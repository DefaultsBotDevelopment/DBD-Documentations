# Controller

## Information

The server controller module allows users from discord to control your severs. This module can be used to start, stop, restart, update and view the status of your servers.

To control a server you need to use the `/controller` command followed by action and server name. Once the command is sent the bot will reply with a message once the action has been completed.

With this module you can allow staff to control your servers without giving them access to sensetive information.

## Command(s)

`<>` Required `()` Optional

**`/controller <action> <server>`** - Sends the action to the server.

## Configuration

The configuration options are located in the `config.js` file under the `controller` section inside the `modules` object.

### Options

```js title="config.js → modules → controller"
controller: {
	enabled: true, // Whether or not the server controller will be enabled.
	allowed_role_id: '', // The roles that are allowed to use the server controller.
}

```

## Translations

The translations are located in the `config.js` file like the configuration options. The translations are located in the `controller` section inside the `translations` object.
