# Auctions

## Information

Auctions is a module that allows players to auction their items and dinos. When a player auctions an item or dino the module will create a new auction in the auctions channel.

Once the auction is created players can bid on the auction by clicking on the button under the auction embed. Everytime someone places a bid the auction message will be updated with the new bid listing them in a list inside the embed.

When the auction ends the auction message will be updated and the auction will be closed. Once ended the module will create a negotiation channel where the seller has to select a winner. Once the winner is selected the module will add the winner to the negotiation channel so both players can negotiate the trade.

Once the trade is completed the seller can close the negotiation channel, this will remove the channel and the auction message to keep the auctions channel clean. If the seller does not close the negotiation channel the module will close it after X amount of hours (configurable).
