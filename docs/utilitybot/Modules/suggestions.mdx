# Suggestions

## Information

The suggestions module allows players to create suggestions for your server(s). Once the player uses the suggest command the module will create a new suggestion inside the suggestion channel with the players suggestion. The module will also add reactions to the suggestion message so players can vote on the suggestion.

This way you can get a better idea of what your players want to see on your server(s).
