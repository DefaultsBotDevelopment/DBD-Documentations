# Embedder

## Information

The embedder module allows staff to create and edit embeds across your discord server. This module is a great way to make your server look more professional and organized.

You can send embeds with the embedder command, once sent the module will keep track of each embed and updates then if the confiuration has changed. This means you can edit the embeds without having to resend them every time.

:::note Additional information
**Multiple embeds** → If you want to add more embeds you can copy the embed object and change the information and place it in the array.

**Embed fields** → The embed fields are a list of fields. Each field has its own configuration options. To remove all the fields you can set the `embed_fields` option to an empty array (`[]`). To add more fields you can copy the field object and change the information and place it in the array.

**Auto updating** → The bot will automatically update the embeds when the configuration has been changed. So you don't have to restart the bot to update the embeds.
