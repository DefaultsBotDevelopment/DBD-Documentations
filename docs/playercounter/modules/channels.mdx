# Counter Channels

## Information

This module allows you to display the server status inside a channel name. Some placeholders are limited to one server, when you use one of these placeholders the channel will take the data from the first server in the list.

## Configuration

The configuration options are located in the `config.js` file under the `counterChannels` section.

### Options

```js title="config.js → counterChannels"
counterChannels: [
	// the list of counter channels
	{
		channelId: '1080512273484890152', // the channel id of the counter channel
		servers: ['Server1', 'Server2'], // a list of server ids to include in the counter channel
		channelName: '{statusEmoji}{locked} Server 1 {totalPlayers}/{totalMaxPlayers}', // the name of the counter channel
		statusEmojis: {
			// the emojis to use for the status of the servers
			online: '✅', // will be used if the server is online
			offline: '❌', // will be used if the server is offline
			locked: '🔒', // used when the server has a password
		},
	},
],
```
