# Role Permissions

## Information

This section will explain how to use the role permissions module. The Rcon Commander bot has a system that allows you to allow users with a specific role to only allow them to use specific commands. This is useful if you want to give your moderators access to the `kick` command but not the `ban` command.

## Configuration

The configuration options are located in the `config.js` file under the `rolePermissions` section.

### Options

```js title="config.js â†’ rolePermissions"
rolePermissions: {
	// role ids that have access to the bot
	fullAccess: ['1015588499971395614'], // list of roles ids with full bot permission
	limitedAccess: [
		// roles that have access to specific commands and scripts
		{
			roleId: '1004718841844207646', // role id
			commands: ['listplayers'], // list of commands
			scripts: ['script1'], // list of script names
		},
	],
},
```
