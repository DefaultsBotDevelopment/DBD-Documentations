# Reporting

## Information

The reporting module allows staff to create reports on players. The module keeps track of all reports and allows staff to search and filter trough them. This way its easy to find reports on a specific player or reports that are still open.

When a staff member creates a report, the module will store the data inside a database. Once the report is created it will also send a message inside the reports channel to notify other staff members. You can also make this channel public so players can see the reports too.

When filtering trough reports you can list all reports, tribe reports, player reports, reports by moderator and plenty more.

## Command(s)

`<>` Required `()` Optional

**`/report create <name> <reason> <punishment> <player_names> <player_ids> (proof)`** - Creates a new report.

**`/report delete <case>`** - Deletes a report by case number.

**`/report search <search_by> <value> (exact)`** - Searches for a report.
