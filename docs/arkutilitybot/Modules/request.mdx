# Requests

## Information

The requests module allows users to request items and dinos. When a user requests an item or dino the module will send a message to the requests channel with the request.

When a player wants to trade with the user who requested the item or dino the player can click the trade button under the request message. Once clicked the module will create a private negotiation channel where both players can negotiate the trade.

Once the request is completed the user who requested the item or dino can click the complete button in the negotiation channel. Once clicked the module will close the negotiation channel and remove the request message from the requests channel. This way the requests channel will only contain active requests.

If the user who requested the item or dino wants to cancel the request they can click the cancel button in the negotiation channel. Once clicked the module will close the negotiation channel but will keep the request available in the requests channel.
