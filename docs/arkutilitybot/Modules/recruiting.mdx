# Recruiting

## Information

The recruiting module allows players and tribes to recruit new members. When a player is looking for a tribe or a tribe is looking for a player, they can use the recruiting module to find each other. The recruiting module is a great way to find new members for your tribe or a new tribe to join.

When a player uses the recruit command the module will create a new recruit message in the recruiting channel. If a player wants to join or recruit a player they can click on the recruit button under the message. Once clicked both players will be added to a private negotiation channel where they can discuss the details of the recruitment.

Once the negotiation is complete the recruiter can complete the recruitment by clicking the complete button inside the negotiation channel. If the recruiter cancels the recruitment the negotiation channel will be deleted, the recruit message will stay available in the recruiting channel.

## Command(s)

`<>` Required `()` Optional

**`/recruit tribe <name> <playtime> <age> <languages> <timezone> <info>`** - Creates a new tribe recruit in the recruiting channel.
