# ArkShop

## Information

The ArkShop Module allows players to trade kits and points with other players, when the player has linked their steam account with the discord server they can use the module to trade points and kits with other players. The target player must also have linked their steam account with the discord server for this to work.

Players can also display their Ark Shop data with the display command. This will show the player their points, kits and how many points they have spent.

## Command(s)

`<>` Required `()` Optional

**`/arkshop points trade <player> <amount>`** - Trade points with another player.

**`/arkshop points display`** - Display your Ark Shop data.

**`/arkshop kits trade <player> <kit> <amount>`** - Trade kits with another player.

## Configuration

The configuration options are located in the `config.js` file under the `arkshop` section inside the `modules` object.
