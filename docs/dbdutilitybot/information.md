# Information

Here is some general information about the to help you get started.

This bot comes with a variety of utility features such as a reporting system, a trading system, a recruitment command, and more. You can find all the configuration options [**here**](/docs/dbdutilitybot/configuration).

## What is Cron?

This bot uses cron to schedule tasks. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. Cron is used to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. This allows you to schedule the bot to run actions at specific times.

When you would use timestamps you would need to update the timestamps every time you want to change the time or after every wipe. With cron you can just set it and forget it because it will automatically determine the next wipe time.

Check out [cronmaker](http://www.cronmaker.com/) if you need help creating your cron expression.
