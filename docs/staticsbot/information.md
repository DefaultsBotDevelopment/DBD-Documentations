# Information

Here is some general information about the bot to help you get started.

DBD StaticsBot is used to display stats from specific databases from plugins that store data from players in-game. This bot only displays the data from existing databases and does not source the data itself. This means you would need to have at least one plugin/system that stores data from players inside a mysql database.

:::info
This bot works with any plugin that stores data in a mysql database.

:::info
The bot does support all games as long as there is a plugin that stores data from players in a mysql database.

## Bot Setup

There are 2 ways to setup the bot, you can either use the compiled version or the bot, or you can run the node version of the bot. The compiled version is easier to setup, but the node version is more flexible when you host bots remotely.

### Compiled Version

The compiled version of the bot is the easiest way to setup the bot. You can download the latest version of the bot in the support server.

1. Download the latest version of the bot from the support server.
2. Run the bot and activate it with the hwid thats displayed in the console. (more information on activation [**here**](/docs/activations))
3. Once activated, you can start configuring the bot. (more information on configuration [**here**](/docs/staticsbot/configuration))
4. Finally you can start the bot, and it should run without any issues.

### Node Version

The node version of the bot has multiple files so get all the files inside the nodejs folder. You can download the latest version of the bot in the support server.

1. Once all the files are downloaded, and added into the same folder, you can start configuring the bot. (more information on configuration [**here**](/docs/staticsbot/configuration))
2. When you are done configuring the bot, you can start the bot by running the `index.js` file.

**Note:** If you have any issues make sure you create a forum post in the support server.
