# Information

Here is some general information about the bot to help you get started.

DBD StaticsBot is used to display stats from specific databases from plugins that store data from players in-game. This bot only displays the data from existing databases and does not source the data itself. This means you would need to have at least one plugin/system that stores data from players inside a mysql database.

:::info
This bot works with any plugin that stores data in a mysql database.

:::info
The bot does support all games as long as there is a plugin that stores data from players in a mysql database.
