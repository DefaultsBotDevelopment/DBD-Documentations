# Configuration

This bot is highly configurable, there are a ton of settings you can change to make the bot work exactly how you want it to. Below are all the settings you can change, and what they do.

## Multiple Database Support

The bot supports multiple databases, this means you can select multiple stats from multiple database to display into one. This is useful if you want to display stats from multiple plugins into one leaderboard or stats page.

To make this work the bot uses bpPaths in the configuration file, this is basically a path to the database column so the bot knows where to get the data from. Below is an example of a bpPath:

Config option: `lethalquests>lethalquests_stats>Name`

This bpPath will get the Name column from the lethalquests_stats table in the lethalquests database.

:::warning
Please keep in mind that each step is separated by a `>` and that the first step is the database name, the second step is the table name and the third step is the column name.
