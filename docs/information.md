2. Type `/license display` anywhere in the support server or in the bot DMs.
3. Copy your account ID and place this in the bot's configuration file.
4. Configure the bot's configuration file and start the bot.
5. Copy the HWID from the bots console and enter this in the `license update hwid` command.
6. Last step is to restart the bot, and you are done!

## Common Issues

### Bot is not activating

This is most likely because you have not entered your account ID in the configuration file. If you have entered your account ID, make sure you have entered it correctly. If you are sure you have entered it correctly, make sure you have entered the HWID correctly. If you have entered the HWID correctly, make sure you have restarted the bot after you have entered the HWID.

### The bot is closing after startup

This means there has been an error on startup, you can run the bot in a terminal to see the error. If you are unable to fix the error, please contact support.

## Support

If you have any issues with the bot, please contact support in the support server. You can find the support server [**here**](https://discord.gg/5xEwm8e6Vy).
